Overview
--------
I matriculated in 2017 as an MD/PhD trainee in the joint Medical Scientist Training Program at the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. I graduated in 2016 from Johns Hopkins University with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering. My clinical interests are in neurology and psychiatry.

Research Interests
------------------
I am interested in applying genomic and bioinformatic analyses to investigate genetic contribution to human health and disease, particularly in brain disease and disorders. I worked with Drs. Brady Maher and [Andrew Jaffe](http://aejaffe.com) at the Lieber Institute for Brain Development as an undergraduate student and research assistant. I rotated with [Andreas Pfenning](http://www.pfenninglab.org) at CMU in summer 2017 and [Anne-Ruxandra Carvunis](http://www.carvunis.com) in summer 2018.
