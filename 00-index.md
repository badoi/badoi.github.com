Overview
--------
I am an MD/PhD traineed in the joint MSTP at the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. My research comprises utilizing genome-wide assay data to inform questions about human health and disease, with a particular focus to those of the brain. Accordingly, my clinical interests lie in neurology and psychiatry.

Research Interests

In Pittsburgh, I rotated with [Awndreas Pfenning](http://www.pfenninglab.org) at CMU in summer 2017 and [Anne-Ruxandra Carvunis](http://www.carvunis.com) in summer 2018.
