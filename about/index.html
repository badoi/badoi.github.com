	<h1>About me:</h1>
	<p>I graduated in 2016 from Johns Hopkins University with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering. After continuing research with the Maher and Jaffe labs for a year, I matriculated into the 2017 entering MSTP class at the University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine.</p.
	<p> My research interests since have been in molecular psychiatry, genomics, bioinformatics, and human genetics. I rotated with the Pfenning lab at CMU over summer 2017 and with the Carvunis lab at Pitt over summer 2018.</p>
